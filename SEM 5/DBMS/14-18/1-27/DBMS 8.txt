Consider the following database
Employee(emp_no,name,skill,pay-rate) eno primary key
Position(posting_no,skill) posting_no primary key
Duty_allocation(posting_no,emp_no,day,shift)

Find the SQL queries for the following:

1. Get the duty allocation details for emp_no 123461 for the month of April 1986.
2. Find the shift details for Employee ‘xyz’
3. Get employees whose rate of pay is more than or equal to the rate of pay of employee ‘xyz’
4. Get the names and pay rates of employees with emp_no less than 123460 whose rate of pay is 
more than the rate of pay of at least one employee with emp_no greater than or equal to 123460.
5. Find the names of employees who are assigned to all positions that require a Chef’s skill
6 .Find the employees with the lowest pay rate
7 .Get the employee numbers of all employees working on at least two dates.
8 .Get a list of names of employees with the skill of Chef who are assigned a duty
9 .Get a list of employees not assigned a duty
10.Get a count of different employees on each shift
